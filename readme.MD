# 🌌 Megaconstellations Visualizations

🛰️ Generate visualizations of the latest megaconstellations using this codebase.

## 🖼️ Available Visualizations:

1. **🌍 3D Animation of Satellites' Positions**
    - Visualize the current positions of the satellites in a 3D space.

2. **🚀 3D Animation of Satellites and Their Orbits**
    - Displays the positions of the satellites and their orbits.
    - Orbits are color-coded by altitude.

3. **🗺️ 2D Earth-Projected Plot**
    - Illustrates the positions of the satellites and their orbits projected onto the Earth.
    - The positions are color-coded by altitude.

## 🔑 Pre-requisites:

Before using the visualizations, ensure you have set up the `SLTrack.ini` file:

- 📁 Create a file named `SLTrack.ini` inside the `keys` folder.
- 🔐 Input your personal API keys from [space-track.org](https://www.space-track.org/). This is necessary to pull the latest TLEs for each constellation.
